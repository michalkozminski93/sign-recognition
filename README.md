# Traffic Signs Classifier Application

This is an trafic signs classifier application that uses various machine learning models to detect and classify images. The application is built using Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow and PyQt5 for the GUI.

## Features

- Real-time image classification using a webcam.
- Supports multiple classification methods: SVM, Azure CNN, and CNN.
- Displays the classified images in a GUI.
- Performance analysis of the classification methods.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.11
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyQt5

## Performance Analysis
The application includes a performance analysis feature that calculates the average execution time and standard deviation for the classification methods. This information is printed in the console.
