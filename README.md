# sign-recognition

Sign recogniton project using Python, Kivy, OpenCV, Tensorboard for Android platform during development.
Classification using HOG descriptor and SVM classifier.
Classification using Convolutional Neural Network.
Traffic sign dataset: http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/, extended by own sings' dataset (polish) created from Front View Car camera videos (dataset will be extended during development for better results). 

To be done:
Hyperparameters setting for better performance.
Moving Tensorflow recognition to cloud services.
Comparison between results achieved by SVM classifier and TensorFlow Neural Network.
Kivy framework for Android app.
